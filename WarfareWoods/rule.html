    <ul>
        <li>1 Board (25x25in.)</li>
        <li>D8 dice</li>
        <li>8 Unit pieces (5 assault troopers, one engineer, one sniper, one tank)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Board Setup</h2>
    <div class="lr37">
        <img src="imgs/gallery/p2.webp" alt="">
        <div>
            <p>Two corners on either of the board are delegated as "starting zones" for the two players.</p>
            <p><b>Each starting zone</b> is a square of size "4 x 4", where each player can initially set-up their units
                in any position desired, as long as all of the units fit within the zone.
            </p>
            <p>There are 3 <b>capturable zones</b>, which are of size "3 x 3", one at the center of the board, the
                other two are at the 2 corners that are not starting corners.
            </p>
            <p>There are cells marked as <b>"obstacles"</b>, which units cannot move or shoot through.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Unit Setup</h2>
    <p>There are 4 types of units: Tank, Mechanic, Sniper, and Assault. For each team, there are 5 Assault units, 1
        Sniper unit, 1 Mechanic unit, and 1 Tank unit.
    </p>
    <p>Units may be arranged in any order desired at the start of the game, as long as they fit within the 4x4 starting
        zone.

                <li>Can move 2 tiles (similar to Sniper).</li>
                <li>Shooting range of 4 tiles, which means the Assault unit can shoot at any opponent unit if there is a
                    path of length 4 tiles or shorter (i.e. 3 tiles, 2 tiles, …) between the opponent unit and the
                    Assault unit.

                <li>Can shoot twice each turn, each shot must be landed on a different opponent unit. Each shot deals 1

    <h2>Beginning of Game</h2>
    <p>Each player chooses a side to start on, and sets up their units accordingly in their zone.</p>
    <p>A D8 is rolled to determine which player goes first, higher number begins the game.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay mechanic</h2>
    <p>A D8 is rolled to determine number of units a player is able to move in a turn. If the rolled number is higher
        than the number of units, then move all units.
    </p>
    <p>In a turn, a unit can move to a new position and begin attack immediately.</p>
    <p>Units can move up to their allowed tiles per turn, but may move less if desired.</p>
    <h3>Cover mechanic</h3>
    <p> For a unit U (which is either Sniper, Assault, Tank, or Mechanic) and an opponent unit O lies within U’s
        shooting range, if the straight line between the square of U and square of O crosses an obstacle’s
        square, then U can NOT shoot at O.
    </p>

    <h2>Winning condition</h2>
    <p>There are two modes of winning:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Capturing at least two of the capture zones for at least one turn. This is fulfilled by having at least one
            unit in the capture zone for a full turn, with no opposing units also present in the zone.
        </li>
        <li>Eliminating all the other player’s units.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Power Up</h2>
    <p>There are 2 power ups on the board. The player can move over the power up to pick it up, and choose an ability,
        either: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Type 1 allows the player to choose any unit from the opposing team and deal one damage to it.</li>
        <li>Type 2 allows the player to revive one lost unit, the revived unit is placed back at the player’s starting
            zone.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once a power up is picked up, it can be stored and used by a player any time throughout the game. Once it is used
        once, it is to be removed from the game and cannot be used again.</p>

    <h2>Flowchart</h2>
    <img src="imgs/IAT%20210%20Flowchart.svg" alt="">
    <img src="imgs/Iat%20210%20pt2.svg" alt="">

    <h2>Typical Game Length</h2>
    <p>In our play tests, each battle typically took 30 minutes, but a very careful play through could take 1-2
        hours.</p>

    <h2>Trade-offs</h2>
    <p>Some trade-offs found in gameplay was the position of tanks vs the obstacles present on the board, as the
        limited movement of the tank and long barriers separating areas of the board caused you to usually be locked to
        your direction and your initial movements to be critical in the strategy you were implementing. Additionally,
        snipers needed to be very positioned deliberately on the board as their attack range and angle was
        different from other units, making their long range a trade-off with their limited angle of range. A major
        dilemma that was found was the blocking of shots from the barriers on the board, as it was not always clear when
        the unit was behind or not behind a barrier and therefore made aiming a difficulty and a dilemma between players
    </p>

    <h2>Game Dynamics</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout playtesting the game, several successful strategies emerged. Here are some of the
        more effective strategies which came up throughout the play test. <br>
        One strategy involved two simple ideas: send the tank down to the side zone with the log, and
        send all the geese/assault unit towards the center zone in a V formation. This strategy was quite
        effective in that you are positioning to capture two zones while also forcing your opponent to
        play at a much faster pace. Since the tank alongside a unit or two can control or at least contest
        a zone, much more units can focus the middle zone. This leads to very chaotic fights since
        players cannot always risk giving away the central zone so early into the game. <br>
        Another strategy that was seen throughout was a slower and focused strategy, more focused on
        setting up the board. In this case, the strategy involved moving the sniper unit towards the side
        with no log so the sniper can get a clear shot of the center and corner zone. From there, the
        player can choose to advance their units towards either of the flags, patiently leaving units in
        positions that are just out of range of the enemy units in order to react when the enemy units
        start taking action. <br>
        The final strategy to have emerged started the turn with splitting units evenly between each
        zone. When the opponent starts moving their units towards certain zones, the player will look to
        move all their units towards the two zones that have the least amount of opposing units. The
        opponent is put into an awkward position at times especially if the heavily committed towards
        certain locations and can lead to an early to mid-game advantage when pulled off.
