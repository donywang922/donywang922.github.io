    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>I've been involved in many projects, although they were all less formal.</p>
    <h1>neworient.ca</h1>
    <p>Among them, the largest project is <a href="https://neworient.ca/">https://neworient.ca/</a>. </p>
    <p>This is a Saskatchewan agricultural real estate
        website. This website uses Django (Python website framework) as the backend and native web as the frontend. Its
        front end does not use any framework or library, and even very little js, and most of its effects rely on
        css.</p>
    <p>Three years have passed since the completion of this project, and my programming level has also improved to a
        certain extent. But anyway, this is the first project I completed independently, and it has a memorable
        meaning.</p>
    <h1>Pixel Loader</h1>
    <img src="static/img/pixelloader.jpg" alt="pixel loader">
    <p>Pixel loader is a minecraft mod. It is used to convert any image into a pixel art made of blocks in the game.
        This project was purely a hobby of mine, but I learned a lot during the process.
        A large number of image algorithms are used in pixel loader, which is the largest and most complex Java project
        I have ever done.</p>
    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixel-loader">

    </a>
    <p>Although there are already some pixel painting generators on the market, for now, pixel loader has irreplaceable
        functions. First of all, as a mod rather than a stand-alone software, it can dynamically read all blocks and
        materials in Minecraft. Secondly, pixel loader2 introduces the function of generating non-planar pixel
        paintings, which is a brand-new function.</p>

    <h1>osu keyboard</h1>
    <p>This is an osu keyboard with macros, it can save you 50% of your energy.</p>
    <p>I used stm32f4 as the control board, cherry silver switches, pbt keycaps, pla printing material. Use blender to
        make models, cura slicing, and anycubic kobra to print. This keyboard has become an indispensable device for me
        to play osu.</p>
